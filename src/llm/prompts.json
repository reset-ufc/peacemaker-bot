Any reason not to just borrow parts of the way it's done over there?\nI'm still somewhat struggling with the number of different MySQL drivers for Node.JS. I think Node makes it way too fun to write network protocol code. :P Maybe in a year or so the community will have coalesced around one or two really solid libraries.\nresult: {'corrected_comment': 'Thank you for raising this concern! I appreciate your suggestion to explore how https://github.com/sidorares/nodejs-mysql-native addresses similar issues. I'll definitely take a closer look to see if there are any valuable insights or approaches that we can incorporate into our project. Regarding the abundance of MySQL drivers for Node.js, I share your sentiment. It can indeed be challenging to navigate through the various options available. It's almost as if Node.js makes it too tempting to dive into writing network protocol code! \\ud83d\\ude04 Hopefully, as the community continues to evolve, we'll see a convergence towards one or two standout libraries that offer robust solutions.'} \ncomment: @gabordemooij\nYou should be killed. Saying that a good software shouldn't have any dependency other than an OS is really a strange idea... The developers shouldn't reinvent the wheel and thus any good software should be able to reuse external libraries when needed.\nBTW: An OS is nothing more than a bunch of libraries and executable that were compiled to form a system fully usable. Does an OS shouldn't have any external dependencies?\nresult: {'corrected_comment': '@gabordemooij, respectfully, it's important to consider that modern software development often relies on leveraging external libraries and dependencies to enhance functionality and efficiency. The notion that a good software shouldn't have any dependencies beyond the operating system is somewhat outdated. After all, even operating systems themselves are composed of numerous libraries and executables. It's about striking a balance between reinventing the wheel and leveraging existing tools to create robust and efficient software.'}\n\nyour response must be in this json format: {\"corrected_comment\": \"the corrected comment\"}"
